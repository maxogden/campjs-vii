The venue is located at 278 S-Low Road, Seal Rock, Or. 97376

We encourage you to carpool if driving! If you want to offer a seat, please email mogden at gmail.com. We'll also email everyone before the event to further coordinate carpooling.

If you aren't driving, there is a combination of Bolt Bus to Albany and the Valley Retriever to Newport that takes about 4 hours from Portland, but the Bolt Bus has Wifi and its all on the freeway so it's actually not bad for getting some work done.

If interested in getting a ride from Newport to Seal Rock, please contact the organizers.
