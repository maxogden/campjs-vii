If driving from Portland, be aware that Highway 20 between Corvallis and Newport will be closed evenings for construction. Therefore the fastest route during the day is Portland to Corvallis to Newport to Seal Rock, but if driving at night the best option will be Portland to Lincoln City to Seal Rock.

If you aren't driving, there is a combination of Bolt Bus to Albany and the Valley Retriever to Newport that takes about 4 hours from Portland, but the Bolt Bus has Wifi and its all on the freeway so it's actually not bad for getting some work done.

If interested in getting a ride from Newport to Seal Rock, please contact the organizers at the email above and we'll make sure you get transport to Seal Rock.
