## Call For Workshops

There won't be any talks at Maker Land, only workshops. The goal is to do something fun that has a hands-on and/or physical component and inspires participants to dive deeper into the subject area in the future. Maker Land workshops are ideally accessible to a range of skill sets and encourages participants to work together to build something that they can demo at the end. An ideal workshop time period is 1-2 hours. If approved you will be notified by email.

Use the following Google Form to submit an idea:

You will be in a barn in the forest, and the internet connection will probably not be blazing fast. Try to come up with something that works without great internet and/or has a physical/real-world/hands-on component.

Contact the organizers @denormalize and @jonhannis with any questions.
